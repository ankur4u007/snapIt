# snapIt:
stores and indexes all your photos safely across multiple storage devices and lets you find them instantly using variety of search criteria, for example: person(s) name, location name, time etc


Depends on:
- elastic search for labeling and indexing
- graphql for queries
- deeplearning4j for facial recognition
- TBD: user interface for querying, uploading, viewing photos.
- micronaut as a backend server
